        <h1>Privacy Policy for TearReader</h1>
        <p class="date">Last Updated: 1/7/2026</p>

        <p><strong>TearReader</strong> ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use our mobile application.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <h3>Local File Processing</h3>
        <p>TearReader is designed with privacy as a priority. When you open files (PDF, EPUB, TXT, or MD) within the app, <strong>all processing occurs locally on your device</strong>. We do not upload your documents, books, or reading materials to any external server. Your personal library remains private and stays on your phone.</p>

        <h3>Web Article Extraction</h3>
        <p>If you use the "Web" feature to read articles from a URL, the URL you provide is sent to a third-party CORS proxy service (AllOrigins) to fetch the HTML content. This is necessary to bypass browser security restrictions (CORS) and extract the text for speed reading. The text content returned is processed locally on your device. We do not store a history of the websites you visit.</p>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
            <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
            <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used;</li>
            <li>To display advertisements to support the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
        <p>We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. Google AdMob may use identifiers such as the Advertising ID on your device to serve personalized ads based on your interests.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google AdMob Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AllOrigins</h3>
        <p>We use AllOrigins as a proxy to fetch web content when you specifically request to read a URL.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://allorigins.win/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AllOrigins Service Information</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
        <p>TearReader requires minimal permissions to function. We do <strong>not</strong> request access to your Camera, Microphone, Contacts, or precise Location. The app primarily utilizes Internet access for fetching web articles (at your request) and displaying advertisements.</p>

        <h2>4. Log Data</h2>
        <p>We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the app we may collect data and information (through third-party products like Google Play Services) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>

        <h2>5. Cookies</h2>
        <p>The app does not use "cookies" explicitly for its core functionality. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries (like Google AdMob) that use "cookies" to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device.</p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>7. Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>This Service may contain links to other sites (e.g., via the "Donate" button or within Web articles). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

        <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
