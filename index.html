    <h1>Privacy Policy for TearReader</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: [Date]

TearReader ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use our mobile application.
1. Information Collection and Use

Local File Processing
TearReader is designed with privacy as a priority. When you open files (PDF, EPUB, TXT, or MD) within the app, all processing occurs locally on your device. We do not upload your documents, books, or reading materials to any external server. Your personal library remains private and stays on your phone.

Web Article Extraction
If you use the "Web" feature to read articles from a URL, the URL you provide is sent to a third-party CORS proxy service (AllOrigins) to fetch the HTML content. This is necessary to bypass browser security restrictions (CORS) and extract the text for speed reading. The text content returned is processed locally on your device. We do not store a history of the websites you visit.
2. Third-Party Services

We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

    To facilitate our Service;

    To provide the Service on our behalf;

    To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used;

    To display advertisements to support the app.

Google AdMob
We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. Google AdMob may use identifiers such as the Advertising ID on your device to serve personalized ads based on your interests.
